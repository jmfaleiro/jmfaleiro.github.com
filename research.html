<h3>Current</h3>

I am currently working on the practical uses of determinism in security and correctness of systems. 
Deterministic programming models such as Kahn Process Networks,
guarantee that the output of a program is dependent on only its <em>explicit inputs</em>. We are exploring the use of determinism
in controlling information leakage through timing side-channels. 

<h3>Past</h3>
Prior to joining Yale, I spent a year at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/india/default.aspx"> 
Microsoft Research India</a>.

<p>
Projects I spent a significant amount of time on:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/jump/144882">CScale</a>: Distributed systems are notoriously hard to build and debug. 
An application's core logic
is often embedded in code which manages partitioning, fault-tolerance and other nasty parts of a system. CScale is a <em>stateful</em>,
declarative distributed programming model that lets programmers focus on their applications, while guaranteeing consistency and 
fault-tolerance. 
</p>


<p>
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/debugadvisor/">DebugAdvisor</a>: The repositories of large-scale
software projects contains information such as bugfixes, source commits,
and the people associated with them. DebugAdvisor is a recommendation system which correlates information about a current bug with
the history of the project in a repository. It recommends previous fixes and commits which may be related to the bug, and even 
people the programmer may consult to get help!
</p>

<h3> Geek Cred </h3>
<p>
I received a <em>Microsoft Research Tech Transfer Award</em> for pushing DebugAdvisor to Microsoft's Lync team!
